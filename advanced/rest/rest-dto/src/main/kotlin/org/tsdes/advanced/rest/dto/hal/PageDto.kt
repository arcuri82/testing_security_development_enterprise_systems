        The following is a what can be called a showing off of
        "coding voyeurism"

        The superclass HalLink holds a set of links.
        In this ListDto, we want some specific links, like "next" and "previous".
        So, we could access them with "_links['next']".
        But repeating such keys every time we access them is not the most
        clean solution. What if we misspell 'next' with 'nxt'?
        Even worse, how to distinguish the case of a misspelled key
        from a missing key? (they both lead to a null from the set).

        So, we want to have "properties" for them, which are statically
        checked at compilation time.
        Fine, but we do not want to replicate data. So, these properties
        need to actual refer to the set in the superclass.
        So? We need to override their "get"/"set" methods.
        Furthermore, as do not want to replicate the data in the
        generated JSON files, we need to explicitly tells Jackson
        to skip those properties with JsonIgnore. Note: "next" is still going to
        be marshalled as part of the marshalling of the "_link" set in the
        superclass.
        Last but not least, we use the default "init" to store the values
        coming from the constructor call into these properties (that have
        the same names).
