        To run Selenium tests, we need a browser and drivers for it, which will
        depend on the operating system.
        What about starting it from a Docker?
        Yes! That works great. Only caveat is that it would be on a different network,
        and so Selenium would not be able to interact with the frontend.
        Adding browser in the docker-compose.yml would be wrong, as we do not need it in
        production.
        So, the approach here is to start it in its own Docker, and then make sure
        such Docker image share the same network of the Docker Compose one.
