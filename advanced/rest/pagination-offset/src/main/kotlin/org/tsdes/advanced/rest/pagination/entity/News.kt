            Here I do care about performance, as I will have options in the
            REST endpoint to get News with/without votes and comments.
            If I do need comments, I shouldn't read them from the database
            in the first place.
            This means having a LAZY fetch (which is the default).
            Recall: in a bidirectional relationship, you have to use
            "mappedBy" in the @OneToMany annotation.
