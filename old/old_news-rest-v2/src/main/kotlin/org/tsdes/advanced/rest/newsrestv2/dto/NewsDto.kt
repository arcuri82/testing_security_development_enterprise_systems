                This is the easiest way to handle changing the name of a
                property, eg from "id" to "newsId":
                just add a new property, and mark "Deprecated" the old.
                Then sending data, just send both.
                When looking at which id to use, first look at "newsId" and,
                if missing, only then look at "id".

                Note: to make things more sophisticated, we could avoid
                sending "id" when a client ask for the "new" format.
                But to do that, we need to modify how Jackson do marshalling.

                If there are many changes, another option is to create a new DTO
                for the new version
