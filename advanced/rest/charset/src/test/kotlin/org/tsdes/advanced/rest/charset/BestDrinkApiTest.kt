    /*
        There are 3 mains charsets you need to know about:

        ISO-8859-1   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1
        UTF-8        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8
        UTF-16       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16


        UTF-8 is what you should always use.

        UTF-16 is what the JVM is using internally when handling String objects, eg "øØåÅæÆ".
        You do not need to care about it, because every-time a string "goes out" (eg save
        to a file or sent in a network connection like TCP), then strings will be
        converted to the chosen charset (typically UTF-8, like this very .kt file you
        are reading, but it also depends on the default of the operating system, eg
        the 7-bit US-ASCII).

        ISO-8859-1 is what will give you headaches, and should be avoided at all cost!!!
        Have you ever seen displayed wrong symbols � instead of the characters "øØåÅæÆ"?
        If yes, then most likely someone screwed up and tried to display a
        ISO-8859-1 string with UTF-8.

        Why the need for different charsets?
        - ISO-8859-1 can represent 191 characters (including "øØåÅæÆ"), and use 1 byte.
        - UTF-8 can handle the whole 1,112,064 characters in Unicode, but it is a
          variable length encoding: most common characters need 1 byte, but others (like
          "øØåÅæÆ") can need 2 or more bytes.

        At worst, a document in UTF-8 could be twice as big as ISO-8859-1 (all of the
        191 characters in ISO-8859-1 takes at most 2 bytes in UTF-8).
        However, UTF-8 will avoid not being able to display some special characters (eg,
        think about a chat/forum in which users might want to write in Japanese or
        Chinese). Often, the overhead of UTF-8 is negligible.
        Furthermore, UTF-8 has much larger market share (eg, 87.7% vs 5.8%, see Wikipedia).
        In many systems/programs, the default is UTF-8.

            However, 216 is the start of a multi-byte character,
            ie it is a "leading byte" (11xxxxxx).
            But, the following 108, being ASCII (0xxxxxxx), is not
            a "continuation byte" (10xxxxxx),
            and so the system has no idea how to display such invalid
            byte sequence

            Java/Kotlin do not have unsigned bytes.
            A byte is 8 bits, so can represents 2^8=256 values.
            A signed byte would hence be in the range [-128, 127].
            But when looking at Charset tables, values are unsigned,
            from 0 on.

            So consider the value 216 = 128 + 64  + 16 + 8
            its unsigned byte representation would be:

            11011000

            and that is what inside the byte array.
            However, Java/Kotlin reads it as a signed value, where
            the first leading bit can be used to determine the sign.
            Negative numbers are stored in "Two's Complement" notation,
            which in practice means flipping the bits and add 1.
            So, when read in JAva/Kotlin as signed byte,
            11011000 does represent the negative

            11011000 (flipping)
            00100111 + 1 (add one)
            00101000
            = 32 + 8 = 40

            216 -> -40

            bytes are 8 bits, so we convert to 32 bits integer, which would still represent a -40.
            This means that, when we convert from byte to int, it is still a -40, so:

            x = 111111111111111111111111|11011000

            (note the | that is just to mark the last byte out of 4 we are interested into).
            However, what we really want is the number 216, which as int it is represented as

            y = 000000000000000000000000|11011000

            So, how to transform from x to y? Let's align the two sequences:

            111111111111111111111111|11011000
            000000000000000000000000|11011000

            in the first 3 bytes (the leftmost 24 bits) we want all 0s.
            In the remaining byte (rightmost 8 bits) we want the same 1s as x.
            So, the transformation is done by doing a bitwise AND operation with the
            value 255, which is represented by

            000000000000000000000000|11111111

            bitwise AND ("&" in Java, "and" in Kotlin) means we only kee the 1s that match
            on both sequences, so

            111111111111111111111111|11011000 = x
            000000000000000000000000|11111111 = 255
            ---------------------------------
            000000000000000000000000|11011000 = y

            Note, when working with bitwise operation, often hexadecimal notation
            is used, where 255 is 0xFF
