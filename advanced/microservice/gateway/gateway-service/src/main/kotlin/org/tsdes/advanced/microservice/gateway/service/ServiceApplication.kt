            Recall that there are two main ways of doing dependency injection:
            (1) by field (using reflection), or (2) by constructor.
            The end result is practically the same, with maybe
            one main difference that with (2) constructor injection
            you need to be more careful of dependency cycles.

            In Java, I do strongly prefer (1), as it is way less
            verbose. Many people though prefer (2), because it allows
            them to use mock frameworks (eg Mockito) when writing
            tests. As I am usually against (apart from few cases)
            the use of mock frameworks for testing (as far too often they lead
            to brittle test suites that quickly become expensive to maintain),
            I am actually considering the inability to use mocking in (1)
            as a "feature", and not as a limitation.
            However, if you are doing TDD, and you actually write tens
            of thousands of unit tests even for most trivial code
            like setters/getters, then you want those unit tests as fast
            as possible, and so (2) + mocks make sense in that context.


            In Kotlin, it is bit different, as (2) is actually less
            verbose (no "lateinit"), and also allows you to declare the
            reference as "val" instead of "var" (and using "val" is better).
            However, you might still consider (1) if you want to
            completely shield your project from mock framework abuse.
            Still, though, as mock frameworks have some uses in some
            cases, (2) can make more sense in Kotlin.

            Also note that the annotation @Autowired is redundant, as Spring
            can automatically detect that the input needs to be autowired.
