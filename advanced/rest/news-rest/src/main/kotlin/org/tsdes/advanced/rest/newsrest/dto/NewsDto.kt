/**
 *  A data transfer object (DTO) is what we will use to represent and (un)marshal
 *  JSON objects.
 *
 *  This is just a POJO (plain old Java object), with no logic, just data.
 *  Also note how Swagger is used here to provide documentation.
 *
 *  Kotlin provides "data" classes. These are POJOs, where common
 *  functions like "equals/hashCode/toString/copy" are automatically
 *  provided with meaningful implementations.
