## Note: one of the benefits of SpringBoot is that it can automatically
## configure your system with sensible defaults based on what you have
## on the classpath, eg H2 database with "test" scope dependency.
## Here, I am setting up manually some of these configurations to make
## them explicit.
## For example, here, instead of using real database, I am going to use an
## embedded one.
