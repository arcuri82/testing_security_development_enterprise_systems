# Quiz Game - Part 04

Continue to work on the Maven project started as exercise 
in the first lesson.

In the `pom.xml` file, add the following dependency:

* `javax:javaee-api`


Create a `Stateless` EJB called `CategoryEjb`.
Such class should be in a different folder/package from where you 
chose to have your `@Entity` classes.

Inject a `EntityManager` into the EJB, and then write the following methods:

* `Long createCategory(String name)`
  
  Create and persist a category with a given name. 
  Return the id of newly created entity.
  
* `Long createSubCategory(long parentId, String name)`

  Create and persist a subcategory with a given name and belonging to the 
  specified category.
  Return the id of newly created entity.

* `List<Category> getAllCategories(boolean withSub)`

    Return all the existing categories. The boolean input specifies whether
    the subcategories should be forced-loaded as well inside that method. 

* `Category getCategory(long id, boolean withSub)`

    Return the category specified by id. The boolean input specifies whether
    the subcategories should be forced-loaded as well inside that method. 

    

* `SubCategory getSubCategory(long id)`

   Return the subcategory specified by id.
