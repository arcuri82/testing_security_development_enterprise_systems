            THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

            the rfc7231 states:

            "The 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code indicates that the method
             received in the request-line is known by the origin server but not
             supported by the target resource."

            "The 501 (Not Implemented) status code indicates that the server does
             not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. This
             is the appropriate response when the server does not recognize the
             request method"

             So if I make up a fake verb, eg FOO, I would expect 501.
             However, many servers return 405.
             Why is this very important?
             Because you always have to keep in mind that the frameworks you are using
             can have BUGS!!!

             Is this a critical bug? Answer is NO.
             Actually, I do prefer what this server is doing here, ie returning
             a 4xx error (user-error) instead of 5xx (server-error).

             I would go as far as to say that the "bug" is in the specs, ie
             501 should really be in the 4xx family
